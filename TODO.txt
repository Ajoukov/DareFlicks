Problem Statement: Generate a list of dares to go along with a movie during a slumber party

Users:
1) Phones
2) Laptop 

I/O
Input: Phrase chosen as the keyword, the dares the users input, (*) pictures associated with the dare
Output: List of dares assigned to a timestamp (hidden from the users), notification telling the users when to do the dare

How does it work?

1) Make a catalog of movies, admin selects movie on the laptop
2) List recommend phrases for the dare on the laptop, with the frequency listed (Connect movie API). Users input which phrase should be the keyword on the laptop 
  a) Hidden: The Laptop finds out the timestamps of when the phrases are said (Connect movie API)
3) Each person needs to enter the DareFlix lobby by typing in a specific "Dareflix Lobby ID." Each person can type in a dare on their phones which is sent to the laptop, if the person can't think of a dare the app can recommend a dare (ChatGPT recommend dares). The app will keep on asking for dares until the number of dares equals the number of timestamps
  *) person sends drawing of their dare to the server
  **) generate a picture using AI of the dare
4) The laptop gets the dares from the phones and compiles a list of dares, and assigns each dare to a timestamp of the keyword.
5) Pause the movie at the timestamp, and display the dare
  *) Randomly Select Person for Dare
